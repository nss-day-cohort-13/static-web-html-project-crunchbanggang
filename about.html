		<img src="images/storefrontDumb.jpg">
		<p>After graduating from the Florentine school of pastries, head chocolatier Andrew Meyers had a dream: An artisanal candy
		company that could service the needs of greater middle Tennessee. Having spent his formative years trying exotic candies in Europe, Andrew felt that it was his life's mission to create small batch sweets for those with a diserning taste. In 2003, he moved back to his hometown of Nashville, TN to give his dream a shot. Partnering with local entrepreneur/business woman Carrol Lang, they found a cute storefront in historic Berry Hill. No one had any idea how much demand there would be for the product, and they quickly outgrew the space! In 2007, along with new candy wizard Dave Douglas on board, the team moved the production to the newly renovated warehouse at 2400 Candy Ln. in the historic Wedgewood/Houston area. This beautiful space with it's high windows and lovely white brick walls turned out to be the perfect place for their creativity to thrive.</p>
